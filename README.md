# todo-app

This app is designed by Jini Tracy and uses Node, Express, Mongoose and Lodash for it's development. The functionalities of this app includes Adding a new task, Deleting the finished task. It also takes you to custom tasks. To check it, just add your custom list name after the url (E.g- www.xxx.com/jini). This will take you to a custom page dedicated for that functionality. This was achieved from Express routing concepts.
